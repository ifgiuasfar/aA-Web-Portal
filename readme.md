# Web Portal Explainer

## Introduction

The Aa-River Web GIS portal is a comprehensive platform developed by the web portal team, enabling spatio-temporal analysis and visualization of the River Aa in the Münster region of Germany. The portal serves as a central hub for accessing and analyzing river-related data, providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for exploration.

## Functionalities

The web portal offers a wide range of functionalities to facilitate data analysis and visualization:

1. Dashboard: The fully functional and interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the river's data. Users can access various visualizations and tools to gain insights into the river's condition.
2. 2-D Visualization: The platform offers 2-D visualization capabilities for different map images, including RGB images, multispectral images, NDVI comparisons, flight paths, and land cover data. These visualizations help in understanding changes over time.
3. 3D Visualization: Users can experience 3D visualization features, such as LiDAR point cloud visualizations and mesh orthomosaics. These immersive visualizations provide detailed examination of the river's topography.
4. Esri Cloud Services Integration: Seamlessly integrated with Esri Cloud Services, the web portal allows access and analysis of multispectral data and sense box information, expanding the range of available data sources.
